- Hi, I’m @LostInNebula
- I’m interested in: coding (of course), chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and psychology! (Just a lover of STEM) I came from a neuroscience background 
  so I enjoy incorporating some of what I learned into my code! Otherwise I make random stuff
  to challenge myself in my pursuit of becoming a better programmer. Beyond all that I also post my class projects (these will be labeled in their README's) :)
- I’m currently learning: JavaScript
